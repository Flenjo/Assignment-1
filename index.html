    <h1>About My Self.</h1>

When i was a kid i didn't knew what my life would be like, until i got in secondary school. Secondary school is a time in someone's life that you will have to detamine what you will be or what your future holds.

        <p>First and and famous, I want to start by greeting the head and the brain behind Altschool Africa</p><br>Someone like Jerry Uke (Manager Of Altschool), Oluwasetemi Ojo (Our able teacher) and the rest of them. First time i had of Altschool i didn't knew what it is like until the day i registered as a student. Altschool is a plattform to bring up youths that are intrested in becoming a PROGRAMMER. Becoming a programmer has been my aim right from the first day i had about it and that made me to join Altschool. I joined Altschool not because there's no other plattform that teaches coding. I joined Altschool because of the compassion, the way they breakdown the teaching for everyone to understand, to have a full knowledge about coming, and the good name they have made.
